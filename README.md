#Overview
This project aims to predict pizza sales for the next week based on historical sales data and calculate the required quantities of ingredients for the predicted sales. It uses time series forecasting models (e.g., ARIMA, SARIMA, Prophet) and evaluates model performance using the Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE). After predicting sales, the project calculates ingredient quantities based on an ingredient dataset and generates a detailed purchase order.
